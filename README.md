# SPOPITT: Your Music Matchmaker (But way cooler than Tinder )
Tired of the same old, generic music recommendations?  We feel you. That's why we created SPOPITT, your personalized music curator who knows you better than your BFF (and probably remembers your birthday, unlike them ).

Afternoon slump? No worries, SPOPITT prescribes the perfect pick-me-up tunes to get your groove back on .
Chill vibes at night? SPOPITT soothes your soul with a calming playlist that'll melt your stress away faster than chocolate (almost ).
But wait, there's more!

Discover hidden gems: SPOPITT introduces you to new music you'll love, based on your taste and what's hot right now .

Super secure: We take your privacy seriously. SPOPITT uses top-notch security to keep your info safe, so you can focus on jamming out .

Flask (for that web app magic ü™Ñ)
Spotipy (because, duh, Spotify )
Machine learning (fancy algorithms that get you )
And a sprinkle of other cool stuff (confidential, like our secret sauce )
